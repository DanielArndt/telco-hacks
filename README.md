# README

BEWARE: Most of this content is scrapily thrown together, and most certainly not written to accomodate differences in configuration. Despite that, some parts may still be useful to others.

This is a collection of junk that isn't really meant for anyone else. Just some helpers for myself.

It's posted publically in case I want to share parts with others, or anyone is curious.
